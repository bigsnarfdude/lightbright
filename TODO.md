# Project Lightbright - TODO

## Application Tasks
- [ ] Write MATS application essay
- [ ] Record video introduction (if required)
- [ ] Get feedback on application from peers

## Research to Complete Before Submission
- [ ] Run current steering experiment (in progress)
- [ ] Document any new findings
- [ ] Update results if significant

## Future Experiments (For MATS Proposal)
- [ ] Cross-model: Test on Llama-3.3-70B with LlamaScope
- [ ] Cross-model: Test on Qwen-2.5-72B
- [ ] Larger dataset: Generate 500+ synthetic AF traces
- [ ] CAA methodology: Contrastive activation addition
- [ ] Embedding steering: Intervene before attention layers

## Ideas Parking Lot
<!-- Quick ideas to explore later -->
- Why do late layers (40, 53) have strongest AF features?
- Is there an "AF circuit" we can map?
- Can we train SAEs specifically on AF data?
- Relationship between classifier-based and SAE-based detection?

## Done
- [x] Set up lightbright repo
- [x] Curate BoxGlass experiments into clean structure
- [x] Write research narrative README
- [x] Create RESEARCH_SUMMARY.md
- [x] Push to GitHub
